# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a set of recommended ESLint rules for code quality.

## Introduction

This project was generated using Vite, a next-generation frontend tooling that offers incredibly fast development and build speeds. It includes pre-configured support for React and leverages either Babel or SWC for Fast Refresh, ensuring a smooth and efficient development experience.

## Official Vite Plugins for React

Currently, Vite offers two official plugins for React integration:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: This plugin utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh. Babel is a widely adopted JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features.

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: This plugin leverages [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh. SWC is a Rust-based compiler that can be significantly faster than Babel for both compilation and Fast Refresh.

You can choose the plugin that best suits your project's needs and preferences during project setup.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration (Recommended for Production)

For developing robust and maintainable production applications, it is highly recommended to integrate TypeScript and enable type-aware linting rules. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which can help catch errors early in the development process and improve code readability.

To integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) into your project, you can refer to the official [Vite TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts). This template provides a pre-configured setup that includes TypeScript support and the necessary ESLint rules for type-aware linting.
